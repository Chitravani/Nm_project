Problem Statement
Develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) capable of generating realistic images resembling those from the Fashion MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST is a collection of grayscale images representing clothing items across ten classes. The goal is to create a GAN model that can produce synthetic images closely resembling these items.
Description
Implementation
Utilizing Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch for model development.
Training Process
Iteratively updating both Generator and Discriminator networks to enhance performance and produce realistic images.
Deliverables
Trained GAN model, evaluation results, and comprehensive project documentation.
Impact
Enables data augmentation, image synthesis, and advances in computer vision.
